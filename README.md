# Data Mirroring

Welcome to Data Mirroring, an open-source initiative designed to help users reflect on their social media usage through the power of data visualization. By providing a "mirror" to your digital behaviors, this project aims to promote awareness, understanding, and thoughtful engagement with social media platforms.

## Overview

Data Mirroring is a methodology developped by Daniel Jurg, Sarah Vis, and Ike Picone at the University of Brussels. This GitHub repository presents a variety of applications that have been developped in the process of so-called 'small-scale data donations'. The purpose is simply to transform the  Data Download Package (DDP) that are made available by social media companies, specifically TikTok and Instagram, into more managable formats that can be analysed with spreadsheet software. However, our project is specifically designed to work in conjuncture with the 4CAT: Capture and Analysis Toolkit, where the actual analysis takes place. 4CAT is also an open-source application that can be cloned from github and run locally or in a cloud server. For more information, see https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/4cat. In order to understand these applications, one must understand that 4CAT allows the capturing of 4CAT links. 

## Applications

In order to perform our Data Mirroring methodologyin juncture with 4CAT, we have developped various application that simplify the process. These applications can pulled from each respective repository. 

- **convert-tiktok-ddp:** Allows you to upload the full DDP that you received from TikTok as as a JSON-file and extract a CSV-file that only contains the videos that you 'browsed', 'liked', and 'favorited'.
- **convert-tiktok-ddp:** Allows you to upload specific files in the Data Download Package (DDP) that you received from Instagram as as a JSON-file and extract a CSV-file. 
- **merge-tiktok-data:** Allows you to merge the captured data from 4CAT with the CSV-file of convert-tiktok-ddp.
